#Landing Page using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript 

This is a code along from *How to Make a Landing Page using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript - Full Course* by Coder Coder on Youtube.

I made two(2) minor changes to the initial code solution:
  1. For the hamburger menu fade animation located in the animation.scss file, I used only visibility without adding opacity.
  2. For the button hover efect located in the global.scss file, I used background-image instead of creating a pseudo element.
